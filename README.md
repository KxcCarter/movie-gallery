## Description

## TO DO

[ ] Build sagas to communicate with movies.router.js

[ ] Build reducers to store rows from database.

[ ] Create card template for movie list display.

[ ] Map movie data into card template. This will be Home/List page.

[ ] Create ability to display an individual movie from list by clicking on movie poster.

- Genre data should be displayed on this details page.
- "Back to List" button should be displayed as well.

[ ] Create ability to edit movie title and description. This will use Router to direct user to a new component page, rather than modifying the component directly.

- Allow user to cancel changes or save changes.
- Return back to display component after save or cancel.

[ ] Style app using Material-UI _I may want to do this first_
